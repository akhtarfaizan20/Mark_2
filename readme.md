You have to read the questions and option carefully and give the answer. 
You just jave to type the option A,B,C or D.
For the correct answer you will get a 1 mark and for a wrong answer 0.25 will be deducted. 
At the end you will get the total marks acheived. 
If you have beaten the high scorer take the screen shot and send me, I will update it ASAP.
